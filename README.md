# DRUGGLER
The IVIS project for your local dealer

Student 1: Tobias Vonesch
Student 2: Sandro BÃ¼tler

**Short description:**
We want to showcase drug trafficing hotspots and drug sources segmented by drug type and effect on a global scale with interactive maps. Our key target is to show where common drugs are coming from, where they get consumed and what the local quality and prices are. Furthermore we want to present where smuggler routes maybe go through and where the central hubs for drug traffiking around the world are located.
