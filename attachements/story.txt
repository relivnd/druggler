Hey you! yes YOU! Are you a cop?

B1 => no => goFurther()
B2 => yes => google.com

Okay good, I’m a dealer…

B1 => Go On...

for drugs…

B1 => Okay?

or better said for information…

B1 => What?

information about drugs…

B1 => WHAT?!

an information drug dealer

B1 => If you say so...

By the way, I’m Steve.

B1 => Hi, Steve

What’s your name?

TF => $name => Hi $name
B1 => Ok

Ok $name, let me teach you some things about happiness

B1 => But I'm already happy?!

Drugs are a little bit like stock

B1 => You ean like Dow Jones?

Supply and demand regulate the price as brutal as fuck

B1 => Like Bitcoin?

that’s because drugs don’t know any governmental regulations

B1 => Ok, Like Bitcoin then...

except for the fact of course… that they’re illegal.

B1 => Unlike Bitcoin...

Where are you from?

RB => $country =>
B1 => I'm from

"Funny country related line"

B1 => Hahaha

Okay $name, let’s have a look at how expensive drugs are in $country in comparison

G1 => DIE DREI GRAFIKEN WERDEN GELADEN
B1 => What do we see here?

Let's have a look at the three topsellers Canabis, Cocaine and Meth

B1 => okay

We start with Canabis, weed, 420, pot, call it what you want

B1 => Ooh the dutchie

As you see the prices are globally on the fall

B1 => Hmmmm

In the last few years pot got nearly everywhere cheaper

B1 => better smoke it quickly then

The Production worldwide has rapidly increased due to a lot of countries which decrimilaized the consume of cannabis

B1 => progressive...

Next you see my beautiful chart for the ferrari of drugs: Cocaine

B1 => vrooom vroom

You see, the prices in Europe are quite stable and on the bottom of the scale

B1 => interesting

It is quite special that Cocaine is cheapest in Switzerland, you might have to thank the bankers for that

B1 => Hmmm

Also we faced a huge price drop in Japan in 2017

B1 => But why?

The crazy government over there changed the laws and reduced the penalty for drug posession quite a bit

B1 => wow...

So it's now much easier to get people to smuggle some white gold into Japan

B1 => Guess so

Last but not least we have a look at the shiny diamond: Crystal Meth

B1 => Hard stuff innit?

Over here the Americans are suddenly quite price efficient

B1 => looks like it

Maybe there are still a lot of bald guys cooking some Crystal in old motorhomes in the desert

B1 => breaking bad?

As you see, the Japanese Meth consumers could not benefit from the recent law changes, Meth is there still a niche product which still makes it so expensive

B1 => not a bad thing

You might ask why drugs are so expensive in $country?

B1 => Yes!

Don’t ask me, I’m a drug dealer, not your economy teacher

B1 => hahaha

But I can tell you also Something about Fast Food if You Like?

B1 => Fast Food and Drugs?

I made up this comparison Chart of the BigMac Index for you

G2 => Visible
B1 => What's the BigMac Index?

You see the price of a classic BigMac in Dollars for each country

B1 => okay

In the last years the prices slightly increased except for the states

B1 => no suprise

When I'm looking at those figures I instantly get hungry

B1 => really?

But why did I show you the Prices of a Big Mac?

B1 => Yes?

=> Do you wanna know?

B1 => YES!

Well the prices in each country are all relative

B1 => okay

the interesting question for me as a seller is...

B1 => yes?

What are the people able and willing to pay?

G2 => hidden
B1 => Okay!

That's why we have a look an check how long people have to work until the can afford a Joint, a Line oder a Shot

G3 => Visible
B1 =>

Interesting here ist, that the Americans as the only ones have to work less for Meth than for Cocaine

B1 =>

Also that the Brits and the Swiss have to work nearly the same amount of time to afford a BigMac or a Joint

B1 =>

So that's probably why the demand of Canabis is so high, if you have to decide either to eat or to smoke

B1 =>

You know what my answer would be

B1 =>

That's it

B1 => No already?
